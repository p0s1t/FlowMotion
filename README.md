# FlowMotion
VR project to simulate fluid dynamics for use in the classroom by engineering students

This is, like mol-e-cube, a project that is in the early planning stages, and this repo is more to hold my research materials than it is for any code. I hope to code a small demo over the Summer so that it can be used in the classrooms next Fall. The basic idea is that the code will display a fluid dynamics problem that has already been rendered, and then give the student the ability to interact with the simulation in 'real' time, so that they can slow it down, speed it up, and zoom in and out. While this goes on various metrics related to the code will be accesible to the student (things like flow rate).

I'm having to teach mysefl fluid dynamics but I've gotten some good leads on tutorials for a computational fluid dynamics course that should teach me everything I need. Fortunately, the theory is very similar to using convolutional neural nets, so have a background in AI is helpful.
